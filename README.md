# Mission-to-Mars

In this project, we are going to scrape images, titles, facts, and tables from astrogeology.usgs.gov by using splinter and BeautifulSoup. The most important thing is to get the correct URL for each section that we are retrieving. We are helping Robin to scrape the images of Mars's hemispheres online and adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images along with their URLs:
- Cerberus Hemisphere Enhanced
- Schiaparelli Hemisphere Enhanced
- Syrtis Major Hemisphere Enhanced
- Valles Marineris Hemisphere Enhanced

Moreover, we will be using a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
